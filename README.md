9. Write a program to check whether a student has passed or failed (passing marks = 40).
10. Write a program to find whether the entered number is a multiple of both 3 and 7.

### Ladder If & Nested If:
11. Write a program to find the greatest among three numbers.
12. Write a program to classify a person based on age: Child (<13), Teenager (13-19), Adult (20-59), Senior (60+).
13. Write a program to assign grades based on marks:
  90-100: A,
  75-89: B,
  50-74: C,
  35-49: D,
  <35: Fail.
14. Write a program to check the type of triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene) based on sides.
15. Write a program to check if a character is uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special symbol.
16. Write a program to calculate electricity bill based on units:
  Up to 100 units: ₹5 per unit,
  101–200 units: ₹7 per unit,
  Above 200 units: ₹10 per unit.
17. Write a program to determine the largest of four numbers using nested if.
18. Write a program to check if a given year is a century year and also a leap year.
19. Write a program to classify BMI value: Underweight (<18.5), Normal (18.5-24.9), Overweight (25-29.9), Obese (30+).
20. Write a program to display the smallest number among three using nested if.

### For Loop Problems:
21. Write a program using a for loop to print all Armstrong numbers between 100 and 999. (Armstrong number: sum of cubes of digits equals the number itself. Example: 153 => 13+53+33 = 153).
22. Write a program to generate and display the first n prime numbers using a for loop.
23. Write a program to display all numbers from 1 to 500 that are divisible by 3, but the sum of their digitsshould not exceed 10.
24. Write a program using a for loop to print a pyramid of stars (*) of height n. Example for n=4:
  ```
  *
  ***
  *****
  *******
  ```
25. Write a program to accept a string and check whether it is a pangram (contains all 26 alphabets at least once) using a for loop.
26. Write a program using a for loop to print all twin primes between 1 and 100. (Twin primes: pairs of prime numbers with a difference of 2, e.g., (3,5), (11,13)).
27. Write a program that accepts a number from the user and prints whether it is a Harshad number (number divisible by the sum of its digits) using a for loop.
28. Write a program to generate Pascal’s Triangle up to n rows using a for loop.
29. Write a program using a for loop to display the sum of the series:
  12 + 22 + 32 + ... + n2
30. Write a program that accepts a number from the user and prints whether it is a Strong number (sum of factorials of digits = number itself) using a for loop. Example: 145 => 1! + 4! + 5! = 145.

### While Loop Problems:
31. Write a program using a while loop to find the reverse of a number and check if the reversed number is prime. Example: Input = 73 → Reverse = 37 → Prime.
32. Write a program that continues to accept numbers from the user until the sum of digits of all numbers entered becomes greater than 100.
33. Write a program using a while loop to check whether a number is a Duck number (a number containing zero but not starting with zero, e.g., 202, 1203).
34. Write a program using a while loop to accept a number and check if it is a Happy number. (A number is happy if repeatedly replacing it with the sum of squares of its digits eventually reaches 1). Example: 19 is a happy number.
35. Write a program using a while loop to find the largest prime factor of a given number.
36. Write a program to repeatedly accept a string from the user until the string entered is a palindrome.
37. Write a program using a while loop to compute the sum of digits of a number until the result becomes a single-digit number (Digital root). Example: 9875 => 9+8+7+5=29 => 2+9=11 => 1+1=2.
38. Write a program using a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence for a given number. (Rule: If n is even => n/2, if odd => 3n+1. Continue until n=1).
39. Write a program using a while loop to accept a number and check whether it is a Kaprekar number. (Kaprekar number: if square of the number can be split into two parts whose sum equals the number.
  Example: 452=2025 => 20+25=45).
40. Write a program to simulate an ATM machine using a while loop where a user can:
  - Check balance
  - Deposit money
  - Withdraw money (only if balance is sufficient)
  - Exit
  Continue until the user chooses to exit.
